### Why we ask

LBRY controls [millions of credits](https://lbry.io/faq/credit-policy) that it wants to get into the hands of content creators and content consumers.

Unfortunately, when you try to give stuff away for free, people will abuse it.

Phone number verification provides another method for LBRY users to participate in the [rewards](https://lbry.io/faq/rewards) program.

### What if my phone number isn't working?
In order to combat abuse, certain prepaid services, Google Voice and other VOIP will be blocked for phone verification. If you are using one of these and having trouble, please see one of the [other verification methods](https://lbry.io/faq/identity-requirements). 

### What if the LBRY app says my phone number already exists?
This usually means that there is another LBRY account/email address that's already associated with that number. If you are changing email addresses and need to link your accounts or you believe this is an error, please [reach out to us](mailto:help@lbry.io).
